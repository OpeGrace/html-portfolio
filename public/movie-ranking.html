<h1>best movies according to Opeyemi</h1>
<h2>my top 3 romantic movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. the photograph</h3>
<p>it was a story of a writer that met the daughter of a dead photographer he was writing about</p>
<p>this movie has some of the best movie sound tracks I've ever enjoyed in a movie.mainly jazz and soul, it was really calming</p>
<h3>2. malcolm and marie</h3>
<p>this was a story of a young movie producer and his recovery addict girlfriend, arguing through the night of his movie premiere</p>
<p>totally shot in black and white, just 2 people having a go at eachother all through the night. a classic relationship tussle.</p>
<h3>3. irreplaceable you</h3>
<p>this was a story of two lovers since middle school, when the little girl bit her classmate, a boy, after hearing the story of two fish spicies that bite eachother as a form of affection</p>
